# Favorite Places
## Overview
* This Was an assignment for learning XHR requests.
  * We were required to print bootstrap cards with data from a `.json` file
  * Our JS file was only to be comprised of functions, with no actions happening outside of them.
  * We were also required to style the entire page with bootstrap
  * The page was also required to be responsive for multiple devices.
  * The only thing CSS was used for is a background/text color change, and to add a small margin to the cards.
   * Here is a [link](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/xhr_favorite_places.md) to the assignment.
   * I picked places from my travels, and recycled some info from card to card due to me doing pretty much the same thing at every location I visit.
